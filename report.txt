# Preprocessing 
# Use PyTorch (torchvision) to load MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
# Normalize pixel values to [0,1] or use standard normalization.
# Clearly document your preprocessing steps.
# load data https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html
# normalize [0,1] = transforms.ToTensor() divide pixel values (0–255) by 255 → range becomes 0 → 1
# std normalize = transforms.ToTensor() → transforms.Normalize(mean, std) Shift & scale values so they have mean ≈ 0 and std ≈ 1
# batch size = 64 because we dont want to feed training data all at once but in mini batches
# shuffle training data to samples each epochs to ensure mini batch contains many classes
